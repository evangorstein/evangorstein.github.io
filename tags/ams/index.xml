      <description>Introduction In the last post, I presented a framework for performing causal inference in a matched-pair randomized experiment. The Wilcoxon signed rank statistic was introduced, and we saw how it could be used to obtain point and interval estimates of a constant additive effect. This approach will not work when the true effect of treatment differs across individuals, and so in this post, I want to discuss a method for quantifying non-constant causal effects.</description>
