      <description>Background This is the third in a series of blog posts for a causal inference project on external validity. To summarize the previous posts if you are just joining us, we are interested in assessing the validity of results obtained from an experiment or RCT in a population distinct from the one in which the experiment was run. If we conclude that the results are not in fact valid in this new population, we would like to somehow adjust the experimental results to the new population.</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post, I motivated the issue of external validity (or lack thereof) and introduced a formal framework for defining the target population average treatment effect (PATE), which is often the thing we’re interested in estimating when we do science. In this post, we’ll try to understand the conditions that are necessary for us to have some hope of learning about this quantity from data, or using the terminology of causal inference, we’ll understand how and when the PATE is identified.</description>
