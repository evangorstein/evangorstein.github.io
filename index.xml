      <description>Introduction In the last post, I presented a framework for performing causal inference in a matched-pair randomized experiment. The Wilcoxon signed rank statistic was introduced, and we saw how it could be used to obtain point and interval estimates of a constant additive effect. This approach will not work when the true effect of treatment differs across individuals, and so in this post, I want to discuss a method for quantifying non-uniform causal effects.</description>

      <description>Introduction Last semester, I made my way through the first half of Paul Rosenbaum&amp;rsquo;s textbook Design of Observational Studies (2010). Rosenbaum is a leading expert in causal inference, an area of statistical research concerned with the identification of causal effects through the analysis of observational data.
One piece of advice I&amp;rsquo;ve heard directed towards researchers in the social sciences who are interested in measuring a causal effect is to get a clear image in their head of the randomized experiment that, were it feasible, ethical, etc.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website! I am a first year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I hope to use this site to put into writing various thoughts I have as I take courses and eventually perform research. Before graduate school, I lived in Chicago all my life, growing up in the suburbs and then attending the University of Chicago. Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball, reading philosophy, and listening to music.</description>
