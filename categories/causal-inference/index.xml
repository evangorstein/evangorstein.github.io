      <description>Brief intro to the idea of causal identification Using data to effectively learn about cause-effect relationships generally requires additional assumptions beyond those needed to learn about associational quantities from data. We can express our assumptions in the form of a causal graph whose vertices are random variables and whose directed edges have the meaning “directly causes.” This graph facilitates our reasoning about how we might leverage our data to learn about a cause-effect relationship of interest.</description>
